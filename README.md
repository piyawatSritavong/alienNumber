An interactive web application built with React and TypeScript to solve the "Alien Number" conversion challenge. This project demonstrates modern front-end development practices, including state management with React Hooks, component-based architecture, and internationalization (i18n).

## ‚ú® Features

‚úÖ **Number Conversion:** Accurately converts alien number strings into integers.
‚úÖ **Subtraction Rule Handling:** Correctly processes special subtraction rules (e.g., AB = 4, CR = 900). 
‚úÖ **Randomizer:** A "Randomize" button to generate test inputs easily. 
‚úÖ **Bilingual Support (i18n):** Fully functional in both English and Thai with a language switcher.
‚úÖ **Clean UI:** A clean, responsive user interface built with Tailwind CSS. 
‚úÖ **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with Vite for a fast development experience.

## üìù The Challenge

The goal is to convert a given string of "Alien Numbers" into an integer based on the following rules.

#### Symbol Values

| Symbol | Value |
| :----: | ----: |
|   A    |     1 |
|   B    |     5 |
|   Z    |    10 |
|   L    |    50 |
|   C    |   100 |
|   D    |   500 |
|   R    |  1000 |

#### Rules

1.  **Addition:** Numbers are usually written from largest to smallest. In this case, their values are added together.
    * *Example:* `LBAAA` = 50 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 58.

2.  **Subtraction:** When a smaller value symbol appears before a larger value symbol, the smaller value is subtracted from the larger one.
    * `A` (1) can be placed before `B` (5) and `Z` (10) to make 4 and 9.
    * `Z` (10) can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
    * `C` (100) can be placed before `D` (500) and `R` (1000) to make 400 and 900.
    * *Example:* `RCRZCAB` = `R` (1000) + `CR` (900) + `ZC` (90) + `AB` (4) = 1994.
